# ros-builder

Build script to build ROS from source on Ubuntu (and probably Debian)
The script installs required packages, grabs ROS sources, builds and installs ROS

The ROS version (among other things) can be provided using the scripts arguments.

The scripts should (might!) work on all Ubuntu (-based) systems with all ROS versions, but it is actually tested with:
 * 64-bit Kubuntu 14.10 with indigo (ros\_comm variant)
